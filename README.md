# Modelling-of-Neutron-Star-
This project models the internal structure of neutron stars by simulating their mass and pressure profiles using both classical and relativistic approaches. It employs the Newton-Raphson method to estimate the initial neutron number density and the Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to solve differential equations governing mass and pressure gradients. The results include visualizations of mass-radius and mass-pressure relationships, offering insights into neutron star properties. This simulation provides a comparative analysis between classical and relativistic models, enhancing the understanding of the physics governing compact astrophysical objects.
